# Simple Keylogger

## Overview
This is a simple keylogger implemented in Python using the `pynput` library. The keylogger captures keystrokes made by the user and logs them to a text file. This project is intended for educational purposes only and should be used responsibly.

## Features
- Logs keystrokes to a file (`keylog.txt`).
- Captures both regular and special keys.
- Stops logging when the `Esc` key is pressed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library

## Usage
1. Run the keylogger:

2. While the script is running, type in any text editor to log your keystrokes.

3. Press the Esc key to stop the keylogger.

4. Check the keylog.txt file in the same directory for the logged keystrokes.

## Conclusion
The simple keylogger project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of capturing keyboard input using Python. By utilizing the pynput library, you can effectively log keystrokes and understand how keylogging works in a controlled and ethical manner. This project serves as a practical introduction to programming concepts such as event handling, file I/O, and logging, while also providing insights into the ethical considerations surrounding the use of such tools in cybersecurity.

## Restriction Warning
Ethical Considerations: It is crucial to emphasize that keyloggers can be misused for malicious purposes, such as stealing sensitive information or invading privacy. This project should only be executed on devices you own or have explicit permission to monitor. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical, and it can lead to severe legal consequences. Always prioritize ethical hacking practices and respect the privacy of others.

## Future Enhancements
To expand the functionality and complexity of the keylogger, consider implementing the following enhancements:

- **Remote Logging**: Send logged keystrokes to a remote server or email address for real-time monitoring.
- **Screenshot Capture**: Capture screenshots at regular intervals or upon specific key events.
- **User Interface**: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier control and configuration.
- **Encryption**: Implement encryption for the log file to protect sensitive data.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Enhance the keylogger to work seamlessly across different operating systems.
- **Key Filtering**: Add functionality to filter out specific keys or combinations from being logged.
- **Stealth Mode**: Implement features that allow the keylogger to run in the background without being easily detectable.
